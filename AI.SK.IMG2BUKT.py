 # The function definition def Do ("Please note that this is a simple example..."): is not valid. In Python, the parentheses after the function name should contain the function parameters, not a string.
 # The line if Function.Do is None: is checking if a method Do of an object or module named Function is None. However, Function is not defined anywhere in the code.
 # The truncate_image('input.jpg', 100) function call seems to be out of place. It’s not inside a function or a conditional block.
 # The except ClientError as e: line is part of error handling in Python, but it’s not in the correct context. It should be part of a try/except block.
 # Here’s a corrected version of the code, assuming that Do is a function that takes a string as a parameter, calls truncate_image, and handles any ClientError exceptions:"
