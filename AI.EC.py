# Define the spheroid object
class Spheroid:

        self.position = position
        self.material = material

# Create a spheroid object
spheroid = Spheroid(np.array([0, 0, 0]), 'wood')

# Define the sound source
sound_source = np.array([1, 1, 1])

# Calculate the distance between the sound source and the spheroid
distance = np.linalg.norm(sound_source - spheroid.position)

# Assume the speed of sound in air is 343 m/s
speed_of_sound = 343

# Calculate the time it takes for the sound to reach the spheroid
time_delay = distance / speed_of_sound

# Assume we have a mono audio signal
audio_signal = np.random.normal(size=44100)

# Create an echo canceller
echo_canceller = pydsm.EchoCanceller(n_taps=3000, mu=0.1)

cancelled_signal = echo_canceller.process(audio_signal)

This code creates a spheroid object and a sound source, calculates the time delay based on their positions, and applies an echo canceller to an audio signal. The echo canceller uses an adaptive filter to estimate the echo path and subtract it from the audio signal.
Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider the acoustic properties of the spheroid (which can be complex for non-spherical objects), multiple sound sources and objects, and possibly reverberation and other effects. You might also need to use a more sophisticated method for echo cancellation, such as a multi-channel echo canceller or a deep learning-based method. You would also need a way to capture and play back the audio signals, which is not shown in this example.
This code does not actually create a 3D or 2D sound space, but it gives you an idea of the kind of operations you might need to perform. Creating a realistic 3D or 2D sound space would require a more advanced understanding of acoustics and signal processing, and possibly the use of a specialized library or software.
Please consult the documentation of the pydsm library and other resources on acoustics and signal processing for more information. This code is provided as a starting point and may need to be adapted to your specific needs.
